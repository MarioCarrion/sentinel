# Sentinel

Sentinel is aimed to be a centralized self-hosted system monitor software for monitoring _expirable_ resources with predictability capabilities and different alerting mechanisms. For example, it could monitor disk space usage and estimate when it could reach the maximum allowed and after reaching certain criteria alert to a channel.

Something along the lines of:

> At this rate your Disk Usage will reach 100% in Two Days. Alerting on Slack Channel #alert
